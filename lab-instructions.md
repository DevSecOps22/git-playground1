## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "Permission denied" when pushing
**Solution:** Make sure you have been added to the DevSecOps22 organization and have write access to the repository.

### Issue 2: Merge conflicts
**Solution:** This shouldn't happen if you're working on your own files. If it does:
```bash
git status  # See which files have conflicts
# Edit the files to resolve conflicts
git add <resolved-files>
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
```

### Issue 3: Wrong branch
**Solution:** Check your current branch:
```bash
git branch  # Shows all branches, current one marked with *
git switch <correct-branch>
```

### Issue 4: Forgot to commit before switching branches
**Solution:** Commit or stash your changes:
```bash
git stash  # Temporarily save changes
git switch <other-branch>
git stash pop  # Restore changes when needed
```
